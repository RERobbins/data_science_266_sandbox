        "# An Introduction to Vector Databases\n",
        "\n",
        "A vector database, also known as a vector search engine or similarity search database, is a type of database that specializes in storing and retrieving high-dimensional vectors efficiently.  The embeddings we have been using are high-dimensional vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of question answering tasks, vector databases can be particularly useful for tasks like semantic search, where you want to find documents or data points that are semantically similar to a given query.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional relational databases are not well-suited for efficiently querying and retrieving semantically similar data. Vector databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle similarity-based searches efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Vector databases are an essential component of modern natural language processing solutions that are built to apply the generative capabilities of large language models to data collections.  This approach is called retrieval augmented generation or \"RAG\".\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG is used in tasks like question answering.  With RAG, a retrieval component first selects a set of relevant documents or passages from a larger corpus, and then a generation component generates the final response based on the selected information. This approach aims to combine the accuracy of retrieval with the flexibility of generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook builds on our work with embeddings in the prior notebook by introducing vector databases.  The next notebook in this sequence covers question answering using RAG.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use Qdrant, a vector database and explore some of the most important concepts.  For this notebook, we use an ephemeral vector database by default, but we also show how you could use a persistent vector database instead.  For anything beyond toy examples, we would use a persistent database.\n",
        "\n",
        "Working with other vector databases is easy.  If you want to explore further, popular alternatives to consider include [Chroma](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/chroma), [Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS)](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss), [Pinecone](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/pinecone),  and [Weaviate](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/weaviate).  A more comprehensive set supported by LangChain is set out [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/).\n",
        "\n",
        "# Vector Database Embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of a generative large language model can be decoupled from the selection of the embedding model used in an accompanying vector database.  The generative models we use from OpenAI and Cohere take a string as input and not an embedding.  When performing similarity search, you will want to use the same model for generating the embeddings as for turning the query into an embedding for use with the vector database.  Your goal will be to get the string representation of the embeddings returned from the vector database.  LangChain can pass back the results as strings inside LangChain document objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Up to this point we have experimented with several different embedding models.  For the remaining exercises, we will use a different embedding model.  We will use `multi-qa-mpnet-base-cos-v1` from the SentenceTransformer collection.  It is based on `microsoft/mpnet-base` and has a maximum token length of `512`.  The embeddings are normalized and cosine-similarity is an appropriate choice for a distance function.  \n",
        "\n",
        "We could have selected the OpenAI embedding model, the Cohere model or many others.  We picked the SentenceTransformer model to make the decoupling between the generative model and embedding model clear.  In practice, we expect that most people will use the embedding model that is most often associated with the generative model they select, i.e., the OpenAI embedding model with OpenAI generative models.  The point is, you have a choice.  Your selection will be influenced by many factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, you can experiment with other embedding models in this notebook. If you want to use embedding models covered in the first notebook in this sequence, refer back to the information there about getting API keys and setting up your environment as need be.\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenAI trial accounts expire after three months.  If you want to use OpenAI embeddings after three months you will need to upgrade to paid access.  Cohere trial accounts do not expire, but the API rate limiting is more significant than OpenAI trial account rate limiting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The default embedding model for this notebook is not tied to an OpenAI, Cohere or any other membership.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results the examples below will likely vary depending on the embedding model."

        "Document chunking, also known as text segmentation or document splitting, refers to the process of breaking down large documents or pieces of text into smaller, manageable segments before feeding them to large language models. There are several reasons why chunking is important when working with these models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Chunking documents when working with large language models is essential to overcome input limitations, improve performance, manage costs, ensure complete responses, maintain contextual coherence, and guide the model's attention effectively. It allows you to make the most out of these powerful models when dealing with lengthy or complex text documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following code cells, we will download several corporate privacy policies from the web.  We will use document loaders specific to `pdf` files or `urls` as the case may be.\n",
        "\n",
        "We the use LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to chunk each document.  See the relevant [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/text_splitters/recursive_text_splitter).\n",
        "\n",
        "For our default embedding model, the maximum number of tokens is `512`.  If we assume that each token, on average, relates to five characters of text, we should be able to use a chunk size of 2,560 characters.  To be conservative, we will use 2,000 characters.  We also need to decide how much our chunks will overlap.  We will use 25% of the maximum, so 500 characters.  You can experiment with those settings in the code below.\n",

As a result, focusing detection of violations against individual pieces \\n of content, rather than detection of people, is generally the most effective way to address this \\n challenge. If we tried to identify or predict people who might engage in hate speech — for \\n example by building a model to predict the type of person who might post hate speech — we \\n would run into accuracy and fairness issues.  34  It  would likely exhibit unacceptable biases and not \\n be able to account for the nuance of discrimination and hate in every country around the world. \\n This is because there is no singular profile of a hate speaker or recipient. Hate speech varies from \\n country to country or even group to group.  35  However,  we have found success in predicting \\n content that is likely hate speech by comparing previously-confirmed hate speech to new \\n instances we see on our platforms. \\n Data Minimization \\n When we look at hate speech detection and enforcement through a privacy lens, we want to \\n minimize data used in our automated enforcement to the most relevant data, and in this case, \\n text and images in previously-confirmed instances of hate speech are often the most relevant to \\n determining if a new piece of content is hate speech.
